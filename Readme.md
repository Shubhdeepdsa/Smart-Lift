# Smart Lift Simulation Project

## Project Overview

This project simulates a smart lift system in a multi-floor building. The goal is to create a web-based application where users can input their desired floor, and the system assigns them to the optimal lift. Additionally, the system will simulate real-life lift usage, where lifts move even without user input, mimicking a real-world scenario.

## Tech Stack

### 1. Frontend: React with CSS Animations
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **CSS Animations**: For simulating lift movement (e.g., moving boxes up and down to represent lifts).
- **Tailwind CSS (Optional)**: For styling the UI with utility-first CSS classes.

### 2. Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- **Node.js**: For handling backend logic and simulation.
- **Express.js**: For building REST APIs to manage lift allocations and system configurations.

### 3. Real-Time Communication: Socket.IO
- **Socket.IO**: For real-time communication between the backend and frontend. This will be used to push updates on lift positions and states to the frontend.

### 4. Database: MongoDB (Optional)
- **MongoDB**: For storing lift usage data, maintenance logs, and other relevant information if persistence is required.

### 5. State Management: Redux (Optional)
- **Redux**: For managing the state of the application if the project becomes complex. This helps maintain a consistent state across the frontend.

## Key Components

### 1. Lift Management Algorithm
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Assigns lifts to user requests based on current lift positions, direction, and load.
- **Idle Movement**: Lifts return to a default position (e.g., ground floor) after a period of inactivity.

### 2. Simulation Engine
- **Random Requests**: Generates random lift requests at intervals to simulate real-life scenarios.
- **Idle Lift Movement**: Simulates lifts moving to idle positions when not in use.
- **Load Simulation**: Randomly assigns load to lifts, affecting their behavior and contributing to predictive maintenance.

### 3. Real-Time Data Handling
- **WebSockets (Socket.IO)**: The backend uses WebSockets to send real-time updates about lift movements and state changes to the frontend.

### 4. User Interface (UI)
- **Input Displays**: Users can input their desired floor on dedicated displays. These displays do not show lift movement.
- **Lift Displays**: Each lift has an external display showing its current floor and movement direction.
- **Lift Movement Simulation**: Lifts are represented as boxes that move up and down on the screen based on their current state.

### 5. Predictive Maintenance and Energy Optimization
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Based on simulated usage data, the system triggers alerts when lifts need maintenance.
- **Energy Optimization**: Lifts enter a "rest" state after being idle for a certain period to save energy.

## System Workflow

### 1. User Interaction
- Users approach one of the input displays and enter their desired floor.
- The system evaluates all lifts and assigns the optimal one based on real-time data.
- The user is notified which lift to use.

### 2. Simulation Workflow
- The simulation engine generates random floor requests at intervals, even without user input.
- Lifts are assigned to these requests, and the frontend is updated via WebSockets.
- Lifts move to idle positions when not in use, with their positions continuously updated on the frontend.

### 3. Real-Time Communication
- The backend sends updates to the frontend via WebSockets whenever a lift moves or changes state.
- The frontend updates the lift displays accordingly, showing the current floor of each lift.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Implementation
- **Node.js Server**: Hosts the backend logic and serves the frontend.
- **Express.js API**: Handles requests for lift allocations and system configurations.
- **WebSocket Server**: Manages real-time communication with the frontend.

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- **React Components**: Build components for the input displays, lift displays, and lift movement simulation.
- **CSS Animations**: Create animations to simulate lifts moving between floors.

### 3. Simulation Engine
- **Random Request Generator**: Use `setInterval` in Node.js to generate random lift requests.
- **Lift Behavior**: Simulate lift movements, idling behavior, and load distribution.

### 4. Real-Time Updates with Socket.IO
- **Server-Side**: Send lift state updates through WebSockets whenever a lift moves or a new request is generated.
- **Client-Side**: Receive updates and adjust the lift displays and animations in real-time.

## Testing and Optimization

### 1. Edge Case Handling
- Test the system with multiple simultaneous requests to ensure lifts are assigned correctly.
- Simulate peak times to evaluate system performance under high demand.

### 2. Performance Tuning
- Optimize the lift allocation algorithm for quick decision-making.
- Ensure the WebSocket connection remains stable and responsive, even with many active clients.

### 3. Maintenance and Energy Optimization
- Monitor simulated lift usage and trigger maintenance alerts based on predefined thresholds.
- Implement energy-saving modes for lifts that are idle for extended periods.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Simulation Features
- Add scenarios for peak hours with increased activity.
- Introduce different types of users (e.g., VIPs, emergency services) with priority lift access.

### 2. Expanded Predictive Maintenance
- Integrate machine learning to predict maintenance needs more accurately based on simulated usage patterns.

### 3. Realistic User Traffic Simulation
- Implement more complex user traffic patterns, such as groups of users moving together or requesting lifts in quick succession.
